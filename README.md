# Knit Picker ðŸ§¶

## Description
This is my frontend capstone for Nashville Software School's Evening 12 Cohort! It's built with React and uses a Google Firebase database. It allows users to keep track of their knitting supplies, save patterns, easily compare their materials against pattern requirements when they decide to start knitting a pattern, keep track of knitting projects together in one place, and upload photos of finished projects to a gallery where they can see everything on disply.

### Feature List
* Built using React 
* React routing for navigation
* Google authentication and data unique to each user
* Full CRUD throughout the app
* Google Firebase hosting
* File uploading and storage through Firebase
